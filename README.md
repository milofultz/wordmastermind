## The Game

The easiest way to think of this game is as Mastermind but with words. [You can see a more detailed explanation of the rules here.](https://www.word-grabber.com/printable-word-games/a-mastermind-with-words-jotto)

The program will pick a random 5 letter word that the user will try to guess. The user will guess a 5 letter word and the program will return how many of the letters from the user's word exist in the random word. This process will repeat until the user guesses the word correctly.

## Future Implementation

- Different word lengths as a measure of difficulty.
- Options for keeping tabs on which letters you've guessed.
- Hints.

## Files

- **wordmastermind.py** - This is the program.
- **10000-words.txt** - The word list.

## Usage

1. Download the .py file and the word list.
2. Place both files in same directory.
3. ```python3 wordmastermind.py```
